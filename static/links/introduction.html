        <h2><span>What is Caliper?</span></h2>
        <p>Caliper is a benchmarking framework for hardware platforms, integrated with industry
            standard tools and test
            cases. It provides detailed performance assessments for server platforms based on ARM64 and X86_64.</p>
        <p>Caliper executes on a host system which is connected to the target platforms through
            network. The performance
            parameters are captured from the targets and converted to score through series of formulas. Thereby caliper
            intuitively presents various performance values and shows the performance gaps of the hardware
            platforms.</p>
        <p>The uniqueness of caliper is a consolidated score based evaluation. The best
            performance in each test will
            get a score of 100. All other test scores are calculated relative to this. This provides a clear relative
            positioning of each target platform. It enables easy analysis of the performance levels and bottlenecks.</p>
        <p>As the performance testing can depends on system hardware resources at the time of
            execution, it is bound to
            vary over repeated testing. In general, this makes it difficult to analyze the performance results. Caliper
            tries to solve by executing multiple iterations of each test on every platform and ensure low variance. This
            provides a more believable and stable scores throughout the report.</p>
